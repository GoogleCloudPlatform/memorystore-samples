# Building a Session Management Service on Google Cloud using Valkey, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL

Session management is a crucial part of modern web applications, ensuring that user interactions remain consistent and secure across multiple requests.

This guide outlines how to create a session management system using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Valkey (or Memorystore) on GCP. By using a caching layer, the application can efficiently manage user sessions while reducing database load and ensuring scalability.

## Why Session Management Matters

- **Consistency:** Maintains state across user interactions.
- **Security:** Protects user data and prevents unauthorized access.
- **Performance:** Reduces database queries by caching active sessions.

## Before Getting started

Some aspects of this guide will require a running instance of Memorystore for Valkey.

### Local development

If running on your local machine, you can use the [Valkey CLI](https://valkey.io/topics/cli/).

### Production

If using Memorystore on the Google Cloud Platform, the following apis will need to be enabled:

- [Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/redis.googleapis.com).
- [Valkey for Memorystore](https://console.cloud.google.com/memorystore/valkey/instances)

#### Creating a Memorystore for Valkey instance (optional)

Follow this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/valkey/create-instances) to create an instance.

You will be also be required to setup a `Service Connection Policy` when creating a new instance. Please follow the [Networking guide](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/valkey/networking) for further information.

## What You’ll Build

You’ll set up a session management service for storing shopping cart items that:

1. **Stores session data in PostgreSQL** for persistence.
2. **Uses Valkey (Memorystore)** as an in-memory cache for faster session lookups.
3. **Spring Boot Applications** Exposes RESTful API for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving session items with auto expiry.
4. **Deploys on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using services like Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, and Memorystore.

By following this guide, you’ll implement a scalable and secure session management system.

## Architecture Overview

- **Spring Boot Application:** Manages session logic and provides APIs for interaction.
- **Valkey (In-Memory Cache):** Stores active session data for fast lookups.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Acts as the persistent storage for session data.
- **Google Cloud Platform Services:** Hosts the application and its dependencies.

## Scaling and Optimization

As traffic increases, the architecture can scale horizontally:

- **Cloud Run** can automatically scale instances based on load.
- **Memorystore (Valkey)** can be sized or upgraded to handle more cached data or higher throughput.
- **Cloud SQL** can scale vertically or horizontally (with read replicas) as needed.

You can fine-tune cache expiration strategies (TTL values) and eviction policies, depending on your data access patterns.

## Conclusion

By implementing this session management system, you ensure high performance, scalability, and secure session handling. Leveraging caching with Valkey (Memorystore) significantly reduces database load while maintaining fast and reliable user experiences. Running it in Google Cloud extends these benefits further, providing managed services and easy scaling.
